# OmniStack Week6 - Challenge
 This project will be separated in theere parts:

✔ 1. Backend based on NodeJs. This backend will be a simple API for create Boxes (folders) and uploading files;

✔ 2. Web site using ReactJs and SocketIO to upload files and automatic resync in real-time.

✔ 3. Mobile App using React-native. It will do the same things as the site.

#### Next step
***At this point, the stack will be the same as the challenge. So I'll modify all apps to customize with a new theme and implement new features. Wait to the UPDATES here.***
